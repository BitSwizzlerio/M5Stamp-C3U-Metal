# Third-party code

## Lua 5.5.1 (`lua/`)

The Lua interpreter, exactly as released in
[lua-5.5.1.tar.gz](https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.5.1.tar.gz)
(SHA-256 `1c4b4068d67061f2a2231ad2b5422e77acea1487ea9890f6320af614f4373dce`).
Nothing in it has been changed. C3U-Metal compiles only the files listed in
`CMakeLists.txt`, with `LUA_32BITS` defined. The full reference manual is in
`lua/doc/manual.html`.
